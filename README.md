# Student Forum
The main purpose of this web application is to create a **tailor-made forum for students**. With a plethora of online forums, there doesn't exist a customized forum for students. Recognizing the importance of the educational forum, the intention is to create a forum that facilitates interactions and learnings outside the classroom.

  Application is live [here!!](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/home)

## What you can expect to see in here ?
The following are the pages that I've developed as the part of the student forum application

1. [Landing page](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/home) - This the first page that a user will visit which can also be called as Destination Page.
2. [Login](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/login) - This page allows the user (both professor & student) to sign into the application.
3. [Dashboard](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/dashboard) - Dashboard is similar to a control panel which is the initial page of this application. From here the student can navigate to any desired page.
4. [Discussion List Page](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/discussions) - It lists all the posts which has posted in the enrolled course group.
5. [Discussion Details page](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/discussions/details) - Discussion thread view
6. [Discussion post page](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/discussions/add)
7. [Course Add page](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/course/add)
8. [Browse Course](https://student-forum-2019.herokuapp.com/course/browse?keyword=csc)

## Application tour :rocket:
Now let us go for around to visit the above pages.

* The application by default will open the *landing page* when served :checkered_flag: . Here we have a welcome section, customer review section and a feature display section.
* Now to go into the application, you'll have to click on the *login menu* in the top navbar :checkered_flag: .
* Ahanha...! You can't just sneak into the application. So give a proper email-id and a dummy password.
* Now we are here in the *dashboard* page of the application :checkered_flag: .
* You can get an overall view about what are the features and how it is implemented in this application by seeing this page. I think the blue button in the sidebar prominently caught your see. If it is so, then I have succeeded in my motive to place it there. That is a quick create button placed there to make the user task easier. It will change according to the page.
* Here we are at the final phase, we have one more page to visit. I think you can see the discussion menu in the sidebar, click on that to visit the *discussion list* page :checkered_flag: .
* In discussions page we have all the post displayed in a list view. Here we have some filter and sorting option.

So that's it for this episode. I know you are excited to see the completed version of this. Have a Coffee and come back to our project review to examine the application with a lot more enhancement.
