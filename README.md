# StudentForum
The main purpose of this web application is to create a **tailor-made forum for students**. With a plethora of online forums, there doesn't exist a customized forum for students. Recognizing the importance of the educational forum, the intention is to create a forum that facilitates interactions and learnings outside the classroom.   

## What are the framework & libraries used ?
This application is built using the following frameworks and libraries :package:.
* [Angular 7](https://angular.io/) - Web application framework
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  - CSS Framework
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Web Fonts Library
* [HTML and CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)- Web designing Language


## What are the prerequisite required ?
 * Node JS - [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
 * Angular 7 - [Install](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

## How to run the application ?

1. Clone the repo to your local machine using `git clone https://git.cs.dal.ca/sharmila/student-forum.git`
2. Navigate to the workspace folder using `cd student-forum`
3. Launch the app using `ng serve --open`
4. Now the application will open in your default browser in following URL [localhost:4200](http:\\localhost:4200\home).

**Note** The above steps will succeed only if the prerequisite platforms are installed in your local machine.

## What you can expect to see in here ?
The following are the pages that I've developed as the part of the student forum application

1. [Landing page](http:\\localhost:4200\home) - This the first page that a user will visit which can also be called as Destination Page.
2. [Login](http:\\localhost:4200\login) - This page allows the user (both professor & student) to sign into the application.
3. [Dashboard](http:\\localhost:4200\dashboard) - Dashboard is similar to a control panel which is the initial page of this application. From here the student can navigate to any desired page.
4. [Discussion List Page]((http:\\localhost:4200\discussions) - It lists all the posts which has posted in the enrolled course group.

## Application tour :rocket:
Now let us go for around to visit the above pages.

* The application by default will open the *landing page* when served :checkered_flag: . Here we have a welcome section, customer review section and a feature display section.
* Now to go into the application, you'll have to click on the *login menu* in the top navbar :checkered_flag: .
* Ahanha...! You can't just sneak into the application. So give a proper email-id and a dummy password.
* Now we are here in the *dashboard* page of the application :checkered_flag: .
* You can get an overall view about what are the features and how it is implemented in this application by seeing this page. I think the blue button in the sidebar prominently caught your see. If it is so, then I have succeeded in my motive to place it there. That is a quick create button placed there to make the user task easier. It will change according to the page.
* Here we are at the final phase, we have one more page to visit. I think you can see the discussion menu in the sidebar, click on that to visit the *discussion list* page :checkered_flag: .
* In discussions page we have all the post displayed in a list view. Here we have some filter and sorting option.

So that's it for this episode. I know you are excited to see the completed version of this. Have a Coffee and come back to our project review to examine the application with a lot more enhancement.
